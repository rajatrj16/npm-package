# Create first npm package

First npm-package and register locally

_Make sure you already have installed nodejs and npm_

clone the repo: using `git clone git@github.com:rajatrj16/npm-package.git`

Here I have created two dir `my-registry` and `my-registry-testing` 

_Below commands will help you creating your own package_

> cd npm-package/my-registry-testing

> npm install ../my-registry

> node app.js
